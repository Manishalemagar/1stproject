<p>Here is a paragraph with a casual tone about me as a college student:

    "Hey there, my name is Manish and I'm currently a sophomore in college studying computer science. Man, it sure has been an interesting couple of month so far in my college journey. Between all the late night study sessions in the library, early morning classes, and trying to balance homework with having a social life, it's definitely kept me on my toes! I'm really enjoying my major though - I've always been fascinated by how computers work and coding is just so satisfying to figure out. It's been challenging for sure, but I'm learning so much. I'm also involved in my school's gaming club which is a lot of fun. College has its ups and downs for sure, but overall I'm really glad I chose this path and excited to see where it takes me next."</p>
